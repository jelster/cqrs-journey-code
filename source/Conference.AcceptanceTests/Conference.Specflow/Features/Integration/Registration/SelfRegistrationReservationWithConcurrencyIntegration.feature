Feature: Self-Registrant scenarios for making a Reservation for a Conference site where multiple Registrants make simultaneous reservations
	In order to reserve Seats for a Conference
	As an Attendee
	I want to be able to select an Order Item from one or many of the available where other Registrants may also be interested

#This scenario with low volume is for Azure build  
@SelfRegistrationReservationWithConcurrencyIntegration
Scenario: Some Registrants try to reserve the same Order Item and not all of them get the reservation	
	Given the list of the available Order Items for the CQRS summit 2012 conference
	| seat type     | rate | quota |
	| CQRS Workshop | $500 | 4     |
	When 4 Registrants selects these Order Items
	| seat type     | quantity |
	| CQRS Workshop | 2        |
	# event: OrderReservationCompleted 
	Then only 2 events for completing the Order reservation are emitted
	# event: OrderPartiallyReserved 
	And 2 events for partially completing the order are emitted


#This scenario with hight volume is for Sql build (DebugLocal)  
#Self Registrant scenario
@SelfRegistrationReservationWithConcurrencyIntegrationDebugLocalOnly
